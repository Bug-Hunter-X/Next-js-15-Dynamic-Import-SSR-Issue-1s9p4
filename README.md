## Next.js 15 Dynamic Import SSR Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15 related to dynamic imports within page components when server-side rendering (SSR) is enabled.  The issue arises when attempting to dynamically import a component within a page component that is also using SSR.  This often leads to a runtime error or incorrect rendering on the client-side.

The `about.js` file contains the problematic code.  The `aboutSolution.js` file offers a potential solution using `next/dynamic` with the `ssr: false` option. This prevents the dynamic import from executing during server-side rendering, avoiding the error.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You should see the error occur.  Switching to the `aboutSolution.js` version resolves the problem. Note: This solution may not always be the ideal approach, and might increase the initial page load time.
